# Objective 
Estimate the mean house price of houses in New York, NY. 
- State clearly how you are defining the type of house: single family or condominiums.
- Go to a real estate website such as Realtor.com or Zillow.com.
- Obtain at least 20 data values.
- If you search results in a large number of houses, take a random sample.

# Dataset
- On 04/05/2021 at 10:39 am there were 3,795 Agent listed “for sale” single-family houses on Zillow at New York, NY (by the end of the day there were 5 more!).
- I used the free trial version of WebHarvy to extract the data from Zillow.
- The free trial version was only able to extract the first 40 listings under “homes for you”, which would make this an inadequate selection of data and counterproductive. I then created a JMP file with 3,795 rows that contained values 1- 3,795 and randomly chose 20 rows. I selected rows>row selection>select randomly and choose a value of 20 to get my 20 random data values. Below is an example of one of the randomly selected points.
