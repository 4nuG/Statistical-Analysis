## Introduction
- In 2007, the I-35 Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota collapsed during rush hour traffic.
- In response, the governor of New York established a task force to assess the safety of similar structured bridges in the state.

Task Force Mandate
- The task force's primary objectives were to investigate the safety of bridges in New York.
- The focus was on bridges with designs similar to the I-35 Bridge, evaluating inspection standards and procedures.

Reports Presentation
- The task force presented two key reports:
a) Initial Report (August 31, 2007)
b) Final Report (November 30, 2007)

Data Set in the Initial Report
- The August report includes data on inspections of 49 deck truss highway bridges in New York.
- These bridges share a design akin to the I-35W Bridge in Minnesota.

Sample or Population?
- The data set in the August report represents a sample.
- Explanation: The 49 deck truss highway bridges served as a sample to draw conclusions about the broader population of bridges in New York with a similar design and type as the I-35W bridge.
- Note: 24 private bridges were not included, reinforcing the characterization of the data set as a sample.

Condition Rating Scale
- New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) employs a condition rating scale from 1 to 7.
- A rating of 5 or greater is considered as good condition, with 7 indicating a new condition.

The task force's findings in the August report play a crucial role in determining the safety of bridges in New York with designs resembling the I-35W Bridge. The reliance on a sample reinforces the importance of robust inspections and standards for ensuring the safety of the broader bridge population.
