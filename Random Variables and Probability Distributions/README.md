## Objective
Determine if a discrete data set exhibits a non-random distribution in the last digits, as this could suggest a potential pattern or bias in the way 
the data was collected. The analysis of the last digits may provide insights into whether the data has been systematically rounded, reported, or 
manipulated by subjects, thereby influencing the reliability and accuracy of the dataset.

## Method 
Use probability distributions to determine whether results can be reasonably explained by chance or whether chance alone does not appear to be 
feasible, so other factors are influencing results.

## Random Variable
A random variable is a variable whose value is a numerical outcome of the random phenomenon. The random variable here is the last digit in the given 
heights of each building and the value for these random variables are 0-9.

## Probabaility Distribution
The probability distribution is 0.1 for the random variable.

## Expected Value and the Standard Deviation
Expected Value = (0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9)/10 = 4.5

Standard Deviation = 

$`\sqrt{\frac{(0-4.5)^2 + (1-4.5)^2 + (2-4.5)^2 + (3-4.5)^2 + (4-4.5)^2 + (5-4.5)^2 + (6-4.5)^2 + (7-4.5)^2 + (8-4.5)^2 + (9-4.5)^2}{10}}`$ = 8.25
$`\sqrt{\frac{(0-4.5)^2 + (1-4.5)^2 + (2-4.5)^2 + (3-4.5)^2 + (4-4.5)^2 + (5-4.5)^2}{10}}$ = 4.855
