## Uses
- Quality Assurance in Data Analysis
- Risk Management

## Objective
- Determine if the process that produces 0.5 mm lead refills for mechanical pencils is still on target. To assess this, a sample of 20 of these leads is randomly selected. For these refills to fit the pencils properly, they need to have an average diameter of 0.5 mm.

## Data Set
- Lead_Diameters.jmp
- 
### Numberic Feature 
- Lead Diam: lead diameter in mm
  
## Method
- one-sample hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction

## Parameter of Interest
- The parameter of interest is the mean/average diameter of leads.

## Point Estimate for the Parameter of Interest
- The point interest estimates the population parameter.

8. 2 / 3 pts Explain why they are different. 

Part 3. 3 / 5 pts Their distributions and p-value are also different. This is due to estimating the population standard deviation resulting in different distribution for test statistic.
