# Objective
- Determine, at a 5% significance level, whether there is a significant difference in the deflection temperature under load between two types of plastic pipes (type 1 and type 2).

# Datset
Two random samples of 15 pipe specimens were tested, and the deflection
temperatures observed are reported here (in ºF).

| Type 1 | Type 2 |
|--------|--------|
| 206    | 177    |
| 188    | 197    |
| 205    | 206    |
| 187    | 201    |
| 194    | 180    |
| 193    | 176    |
| 207    | 185    |
| 185    | 200    |
| 189    | 197    |
| 213    | 192    |
| 192    | 198    |
| 210    | 188    |
| 194    | 189    |

| 205    | 192    |

# Parameter of interest
- mu1 = avg deflation temp observed of type 1
- mu2 = avg deflation temp observed of type 2
- mu1-mu2, the difference between the temperature means of two types populations.
- 
# Point estimate for the parameter of interest
- sample mean 1 = avg sample deflation temp observed of type 1 = 196.4
- sample mean 2 = avg sample deflation temp observed of type 2 = 192.06666666667
- (sample mean 1) – (sample mean 2), the difference between the temperature means of two types
samples = 4.33334

# Asumptions/Requirements
# Hypothesis
# Test Statistic 
# P-value
# Conclusion
# 5% confidence interval for the mean difference (does is agree with the hypothesis test?)
