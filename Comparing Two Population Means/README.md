# Objective
- Determine whether there is a significant difference in the deflection temperature under load between two types of plastic pipes (type 1 and type 2).
- So at a 5% significance level, determine if the data supports the claim that the deflection temperature under load for type 1 pipe differs from that of type 2?

# Datset
Two random samples of 15 pipe specimens were tested, and the deflection
temperatures observed are reported here (in ÂºF).

# Parameter of interest
# Point estimate for the parameter of interest
# Asumptions/Requirements
# Hypothesis
# Test Statistic 
# P-value
# Conclusion
# 5% confidence interval for the mean difference (does is agree with the hypothesis test?) 


# Points
1. 1 / 1 pt 2. 0.5 / 1 pt Find the value of the point estimate. 3. 5 / 5 pts You should verify the equal variance by JMP. Part of your answer in question 5 should be represented here. 4. 2 / 2 pts 5. 4 / 4 pts 6. 2 / 2 pts 7. 1 / 1 pt 8. 1 / 1 pt 9. 1 / 1 pt 10. 2 / 2 pts
